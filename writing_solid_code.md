## Writing Solid Ruby Code

* Assertions in ruby aren't so valuable.  respond_to? checks are
  "chicken typing".
* Are your tests sufficient and necessary?
* Object Oriented Software Construction by Bertrand Meyer--highly
  recommended by Jim Weirich.
* rspec-given gem.
* Fortify your subsystems--don't trust stuff from the outside.
* Use the debugger but don't overuse it.
* Check out Pry.
* Candy Machine Interfaces.
  - APIs where it's too easy to do the wrong thing.
* Consider risk.
  - saikuro gem -- McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity Metric.
* Don't use complicated solutions when simple ones will do.
