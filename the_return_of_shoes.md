## The Return of Shoes

* _Why originally wrote Shoes & Hackety Hack.
* Steve took over maintaining both.
* The 10 gifts of Shoes
* Shoes used to built for gecko
* What's great about shoes:
  * A GUI toolkit that doesn't suck!
  * interface, NOT implementation
  * Write once, run anywhere
* What's not awesome about shoes:
  * Steve is pretty much by himself, and has been for about 2 years.
  * Platform stuff--Why used old APIs that have been used in new OS releases.
  * Infrequent releases
